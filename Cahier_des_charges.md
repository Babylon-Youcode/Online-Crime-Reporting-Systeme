# Project: Online Crime Reporting System

It gives the platform of transferring pictures or recordings of wrongdoing scenes to guarantee that police may make a move right away.

To report any grievances related to wrongdoing, individuals need to contact the nearest police headquarters. Individuals of the particular city don't know about wrongdoing related issues, for example, List of Most wanted lawbreakers of their town, missing people of the territory, etc. People must view News Channels or Read News Paper for such offence related subtleties.
